> This application is for development only, it is strongly recommended not to use it in production environments. It is not deployed with data persistence. For more info or help [contact](mailto:contact@davma.io)

## How to access to Wiki.js

Once the application has been deployed, open the public endpoint navigating through the web UI to select the application, selecting the davmaio-wikijs component, and clicking on the associated Endpoint. Alternatively with the CLI use:

```
playground apps open davmaio-wiki.js
```

The davmaio-Wiki.js instance automatically gets a public URL in the form of:
