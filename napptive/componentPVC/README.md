# Storage components for davmaio-Wiki.js production environment

Deployment of these components is not possible with a free Napptive account

__ATTENTION. You must launch this version of the application to deploy storage components to the production environment of davma.io-Wiki.js__

By releasing the storage components separately you are guaranteed.
  - You can kill the davma.io-wiki.js application without losing the data and use the computing capacity of your environment for other functions
- You can test future versions/updates quickly by killing the current version and deploying the new one without affecting your stored data.

__ATTENTION. You should under no circumstances remove this deployment from your environment. This will lead to the total loss of your data.__

New versions of this application will only be provided once it has been verified that errors do not occur with the new deployment.
